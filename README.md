# Project

This project intends to create a step-by-step register form using the following libs:
- React Hook Form
- Yup (for data validation)
- React Use Wizard
- Json-server

It should be possible to register a new account (only when datas are valid) and this should be available at home page.

## Disclaimer
Passwords aren't hashed in purpose, once the focus of this exercising is only to practice form validationg.
